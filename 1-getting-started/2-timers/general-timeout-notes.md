// Timers // 

Popular global functions in a browers environment. 
Node.js has an API for these functions as well and it exactly matches the brower's API. 
These timer functions can be used to delay or repeat the execution of other functions, which they recieve as arguments. 
Ex. 
setTimeout
setInterval
